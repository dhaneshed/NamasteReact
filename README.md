Chapter 1: Inception

1>What is Emmet?

Answer:

Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, developers type less, they save both on keystrokes and time. Also relying on Emmet's auto completion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust and valid files.

2>Difference between a Library and Framework?

A framework is used for building and deploying an application quickly. When we use a framework, we can use resources to facilitate faster development and a greater user experience. A library is used to enhance the functionality of an application.If we develop our own library, we can use the functions in many applications.


Framework                                      Library

3>What is CDN? Why  do we use it?
A content delivery network(CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds
up webpage loading for data-heavy applications.CDN can stand for content delivery 
network of content distribution network. When a user visits a website, data from 
that website's server has to travel across the internet to reach the user's computer.
If the user is located far from that server, it will take a long time to load a large
file, such as video or website image. Instead, the website content is stored on CDN
servers geographically closer to the users and reaches their computers much faster.
